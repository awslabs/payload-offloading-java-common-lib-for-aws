## Payload Offloading Java Common Library For AWS

The **Payload Offloading Java Common Library For AWS** enables you to manage payloads with Amazon S3. 
For example, this is useful for storing and retrieving payloads with size greater than the current SQS/SNS limit of 256 KB, up to a maximum of 2 GB.
 
You can use this library to:

* Specify whether payloads are always stored in Amazon S3 or only when a payload's size exceeds 256 KB.

* Get the corresponding payload object from an Amazon S3 bucket.

* Delete the corresponding payload object from an Amazon S3 bucket.

You can download release builds through the [releases section of this](https://github.com/awslabs/large-payload-offloading-java-common-lib-for-aws/releases) project.

For more information about creating an AWS account and retrieving your AWS credentials, see [AWS Account and Credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsJava/latest/DeveloperGuide/java-dg-setup.html) in the AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide.
